                        <p>It's never the same tone. Who wants to stop this? There can't be!
                            When the violent storm is over, the blue sky is more beautiful than ever!
                            You see, I want that, I want that! That's all I want!
                            I drift tonight, carried by the waves. I'll just be a black sea.
                            I drift tonight. Please don't stop the flow.

                        If there's a man who can make anything, give me the tools to live in the past.
                        It's all gone down so deep I can't see anymore,if that's not the way
                        to go, let me, let me! Let me carve your way! I'm a shadow always with you
